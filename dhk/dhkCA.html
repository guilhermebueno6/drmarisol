    <h2> The Ancient Miracle Oil For Health, Hair &amp; Everything In Between </h2>
    
    <p>In the midst of my struggles <b> I went back to school to become a naturopathic doctor.</b> This is when <b>I tried an ancient health ritual known as the Castor Oil Liver Pack, and it COMPLETELY transformed my health. </b> <br> <br> If  you  don’t  know  what  a  Castor  Oil  Liver  Pack  is,  it’s  a  cotton  compress  with  castor  oil  that you place on the liver! <b>This nighttime ritual is a foundation for hormone healing because it helps you poop better, sleep better, and stress less... </b> plus countless other benefits. <br> <br> You’re probably thinking to yourself, “What does a Castor Oil Liver Pack have to do with my hair?” Well, you can use the oil on your hair too!! <br> <br> According  to  historical  Egyptian  and  Mediterranean  usage,  <b> castor  oil  nourishes,  strengthens, and grows beautiful hair. </b> I discovered that castor oil was the beauty secret of the legendary Queen Cleopatra, so I had to give it a try. </p>

        <p> You  could  buy  packets  that  had  to  be  heated  on  the  stove,  then  applied  to  your  hair  (careful  not  to  burn  yourself!!!).  <b> I  started  doing a weekly hair mask with castor oil using a stainless steel  comb  and  a  hair  wrap </b>  made  of  organic  materials  (included in the Dream Hair Kit) <b> that naturally heated the oil, turning it into an at-home hot oil treatment.</b> <br> <br> <b> My  friends  started  to  comment  on  how  healthy  and  shiny  my  hair  looked,</b>  it  started  feeling  thicker  and  stronger  and   <b> it  was  GROWING,  longer  than  it  had  ever  been  before...</b>  I  was  never  blessed with this kind of hair. </p>

    <h2>Now I know What You’re Thinking... “How could castor oil work for hair growth?! Is this right? Is there any science behind it?” </h2>
    <p> <b>  Castor oil is full of hormone-balancing, hair-loving nutrients</b> like vitamin E, omegas, polyphenols and amino acids. <b>  It increases blood circulation</b>  to  the  hair  follicle  and  also  <b> reduces  inflammation,  nourishes, and moisturizes and balances the bacteria on our scalp, which helps reduce itchiness and dandruff.</b> <br> <br> <b>Applying the oil with a stainless steel comb stimulates circulation to  the  hair  follicles,  and  the  hair  wrap  naturally  heats  the  oil,</b>  driving  nourishment  straight  to  the  root  <b>to  promote  growth,  natural  thickness, shine and texture</b> (scientific references are in your free eGuide!).</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2> You might also be thinking, “Oil is just going to make my hair worse!” </h2>
    <p> <b> With castor oil, less is more!</b>  You only need to comb a small amount through the roots (and you can apply it to split ends too). You simply leave the hair wrap on for an hour then rinse with shampoo as normal. <br> <br> 
        Now I want to let you in on <b>3 secrets on why this hair mask works.</b> </p>

        <h2>Hormone Harmony</h2>
        <p>Have  you  ever  said,  “My  thyroid  is  messing  up  my  hair!”  or  “It’s  just  my  hormones!”? <b>As  women,  we’ve  simply  got  more  hormones  at  play</b> in  the  beautiful  orchestra  of  our  bodies. <b> When  our  body  goes  through  transitions  like</b> postpartum  or  menopause,  our  ‘hormone  soup’ naturally gets thicker, and <b>hair is often one of the first places we notice changes!</b>
        </p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Castor oil contains hormone-balancing nutrients that help us reclaim beautiful hair. It’s also amazing to help with lateral thinning of the eyebrows, and natural eyelash growth! <br><br>
        It works even better if you combine it with a Castor Oil Liver Pack like I did. Because the pack helps you absorb nutrients in your food and supplements, so anything you are taking works better! Isn’t that awesome?

    <h2>Get Away Greys!</h2>
    <p> <b> Greying  hair  is  a  beautiful,  natural  sign  of  aging,  but  many  of  us would like to delay this process</b> as long as possible. The stainless steel  comb  in  the  Dream  Hair  Kit  stimulates  blood  circulation  to  the  hair follicles to nourish and grow hair, and <b> castor oil is packed with graceful-aging  nutrients </b> like  antioxidants  and  nitric  oxide,  which  also stimulates circulation to the roots <b>(kind of like a natural Viagra for your hair!) </b></p>
