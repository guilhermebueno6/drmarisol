					<h1>A Little Bit About Me:</h1>
					<p> My name is Dr. Marisol Teijeiro – I’m a Naturopathic Doctor &amp; founder of Queen of the Thrones® line of castor oil products. I've been in clinical practice for over a decade, &amp; early on I noticed that all of my patients (&amp; myself) were having problems with stools, sleep &amp; stress. I realized this was our body's way of communicating with us, like a secret code that we needed to unlock. <br><br>
					My life's mission is to help people unlock their body's secret code &amp; heal their gut so they can own their purpose &amp; passion in life. I'm the author of the award-winning book, Oh, Sh*t! &amp; I’ve been featured on various TV programs including nationally syndicated shows (Bloom &amp; Daytime) as well as The Marilyn Denis Show in Canada.</p>

<h1>Health is a lot More Simple Than You Think</h1>
		<p>We just have a tendency to overcomplicate it and that’s not your fault! You’ve been told that it’s complicated, and only a certain top few can fix it for you. Sound familiar?<br><br>

		But that’s not true. <span class="bold"> Your body is telling you what is going wrong and what it needs every single day through stools, sleep and stress – it just speaks in a secret code that you had no idea how to unlock...</span> Until now! Knowing these codes is NOT just for doctors, although they've kept it secret for years.</p>

		<h1>I can’t fix You Because You Are Not Broken</h1>
		<p>After all, you're the one living in your body, it’s you who has to breathe, eat and feel how you feel every single day, why wouldn’t you be the one to know what is going right and what could be going dreadfully wrong? <span class="bold">Others have taken away your power... But this book is your tool to take that power back.</span><br><br>

		<span class="bold">I wrote the award-winning book, Oh, Sh*t!, for people just like you (whether you want to heal your gut, or whether you help others heal their gut).</span> Also because my patients were begging me to get it on paper so they could refresh when necessary <span class="bold">without having to come see me at my clinic</span> and they could be the one to help their friends and family by sharing the benefits. <br><br>
		This is your user’s manual, your bible to new and improved health. <span class="bold">And I’m giving it to you for free.</span> Why? Well you’ll have to read on to find out. <span class="bold">Are you with me?</span></p>

				<span class="bold">My mom was always looking outside for the answer to these struggles and never found it – she needed to discover her body's secret code (just like you will with my FREE award-winning book Oh, Sh*t!).</span> Then her doctor gave her a deadly diagnosis of breast cancer due to her years of daily suffering with multiple conditions. She was devastated – I was, too.</p>

				<h2>Are You Suffering Because No One Is Paying Attention To Your Daily Experience? </h2>
				<p>You may be getting labs, tests, labels &amp; conditions given to you, but no one is paying attention to what you are really dealing with everyday. <span class="bold">What if I told you that unlocking your body's secret code is as simple as paying more attention to your stools, sleep and stress? You will find the code in my FREE award-winning book, Oh, Sh*t!</span> (Reg. 26.99) <br><br>
					
				I remember my mom's suffering with her stools, sleep and stress way before any of her "conditions".  I also remember my own suffering since I was a child before my "conditions". I saw the same pattern in my patients and realized early on that <span class="bold">problems with stools, sleep and stress precede all conditions – and are often overlooked.</span> </p>

			<h1>Every woman You Know Has Problems With The Same 3 Things – No Matter Their "Condition"</h1>
			<p> Whether they were labelled with hormone and thyroid problems, arthritis, autoimmune conditions, or cancer – it always came down to their:</p>

				<li><span class="blue">STOOLS</span></li>
				<li><span class="blue">SLEEP</span></li>

			<p>When your gut is unhealthy, you will notice problems in these 3 areas that come long before you are labelled with your "condition". <span class="bold">This book is different from all the other gut healing books you've read before...</span></p> <br>

			<p>I learned in my clinical practice that <span class="bold">it's not simply about supplements and superfoods...</span> I had to guide my patients to unlock their body's secret code found within their stools, sleep and stress. My FREE gift to you, my award-winning book, <span class="bold">Oh, Sh*t! will liberate you by unlocking your body's secret code and help you follow your own unique and personalized road map–</span> which is often much simpler than anything you've done before!

				<h2>You Are NOT Your Condition</h2>
				<p><span class="bold">Simple problems with your stools, sleep and stress create the ideal environment for "REAL BAD conditions" to arise</span> (like thyroid problems, hormonal cancers, arthritis, etc.). <br><br>
				But good news... Conditions can be changed into new and better things. We must look at how you suffer daily with stools, sleep and stress to unlock your body's secret code. This will reveal what you truly need instead of keeping you caged in your "condition". <br><br>
				You might be thinking "My Dad died of heart disease and my mom died of cancer... And that is my future, too"... But, it's not! You can choose differently. <span class="bold">You can change your present and future conditions by changing your daily environment right now. Simply unlock the secret code in your stools, sleep and stress once you have your very own award-winning book, Oh, Sh*t! in your hands.</span></p>

				<h2>It’s Not About Having Willpower</h2>
				<p>You have willpower... It's just that every other method you've tried, or book you've read has given you a one-size-fits-all approach that has forced you to rely on willpower alone in order to succeed... Only to feel frustrated when you fail.  <br><br>

				<span class="bold">What you really need is a more personalized road map that feels natural to your body's specific needs – one that you wake up and choose every morning rather than force yourself into.</span> In my decade of clinical practice, I've learned where people fall off track – Oh, Sh*t! will keep you on track with simple hacks that make you feel good every single day – <span class="bold">the secret to staying motivated.</span> <br><br>

				You might be thinking "It's too late for me", "I'm too old" or "I'm too sick". If you feel like you can't be fixed... It's because you are not broken. It's never too late to transform your life, you just need clear steps that finally work for you and your unique needs.</p>

				<h2>When You’re Struggling Everyday, All You Need Is One Big Win To Help Keep You Going</h2>
				<p>You might have heard me mention <span class="bold">my favorite health tool the castor oil pack, which is a non-negotiable tool in Oh, Sh*t! for healing the gut.</span> Let me give you a bit of a sneak peek as to why... <br><br>

				<h2>How Do You Stay Motivated To Heal Your Gut When You Don’t Feel Good? </h2>
				<p><span class="bold">Anytime you’ve faltered on a health plan it’s because you didn’t have something each day that motivated you to keep going</span> – not because you don't have willpower. Positive reinforcement is everything. How do you positively reinforce? You do things that make you FEEL BETTER.  <br><br>

				Under regular circumstances, to heal the gut you would need to take mountains of supplements, completely restrict your diet for months, go to multiple practitioners for acupuncture or massage, and who knows how many other woo-woo things that cost you time and money. <br><br>

				I didn’t want that added level of stress for my mom, myself or my patients.

				<h2>The Castor Oil Pack Became My Mom's Miracle Wrap</h2>
				<p><span class="bold">In just a few days, my mom, who had over 66 years of bathroom problems, horrible sleep and extreme stress, experienced true gut healing:</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>She was pooping without obsessing over it</li>
						<li>She could finally sleep through the night</li>
						<li>She woke up feeling refreshed</li>
						<li>She was no longer wanting to eat everything in the kitchen cupboards</li>
						<li>She started to feel like life was easy; not a massive chore that led to nothing</li>
						<li>Her stress had all but evaporated</li>
						
					</ul> <br>
					<p><span class="bold">This Castor Oil Pack was the ONE THING that positively reinforced her motivation for transformation.</span> <br><br> 
					Maybe you’ve heard of it or tried it? It’s an ancient technique that was a real hassle before, but I share the easy, less-mess way to work with this ancient tool <span class="bold">in your FREE book, Oh, Sh*t!</span> because <span class="bold">it is the first, most important thing to do when you want to heal your gut with ease.</span>

				<h2>You Can’t Turn Back Time But You Can Change Your Daily Experience For The Better</h2>
				<p>Just as Oh, Sh*t! was going to print, <span class="bold">my mother passed away at a ripe old age having survived 11 years past her breast cancer diagnosis and she got to indulge during those years because she had very little suffering in her stools, sleep and stress.</span> This is something she really hadn’t experienced in her previous 66 years of life.  <br><br>
				You may be thinking “She probably did everything perfect. After all, she was the mother of a naturopath!” Wrong! I can tell you she definitely wasn’t perfect! But <span class="bold">she was following the roadmap in Oh, Sh*t! which became her gut healing bible, and was religious with her Castor Oil Pack.</span>
