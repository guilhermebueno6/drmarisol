<h2 class='headings'>"It’s a great program and my spirit feels good about giving."</h2>
<h2 class="sub">– S Prince (Member of the Gratitude Experiment)</h2>

<p>
    I got out of bed this morning with this question in my head:
    <br><br>
    “What if?” 
    <br><br>
    Honestly. I’ve been feeling not good. I’m scared. The world is really weird right now. What can I do to feel better right now and help you do the same too?
    <br><br>
    One word just kept popping into my head.
    <br><br>
    <b>Gratitude.</b>
    <br><br>
    What if for 14 days... we did this together? What if you share with all your friends?
    <br><br>
    I created this 14 day program with that intent 3 months ago. But I didn’t fully launch it because I really didn’t know how, until this morning.
    <br><br>
    I know what you’re thinking...
    <br><br>
    This is another scam. It isn’t.
    <br><br>
    This is a fourteen day experience that’s <b>TOTALLY FREE.</b> No strings attached.
    <br><br>
     It’s easy. It takes no more than 5 minutes a day.
</p>

        If you want, there’s a <b>beautiful bracelet that you can also get for free</b> (just pay shipping, so I don’t go broke!) while supplies last.
        <br><br>
        It helps you with a daily gratitude practice. (I'm holding it in this picture!)
        <br><br>
        Do you think the more we are grateful during these tough times could make the world better? I don’t know... That’s why it’s called an experiment.
        <br><br>
        If you are scared to give your email, I get it. Everyone wants your email. I do too... because I want to connect. I want us all to be better. I want us all to feel good.
        <br><br>
        After the 1st day you can unsubscribe, no questions asked. I hope you don’t, but that is the reality. Maybe we might become really good friends because we both feel better...

<p>
    So what do you say? Are you game? Do you want to experiment with me?
    
    What if... becomes answered.
    
    What if I feel just a little bit better today than yesterday? Wouldn’t that be good?
    
    Yup.
    
    Oh and just so you know, I’m not some lunatic. I’m a reputable naturopathic doctor that believes we can all be better, do better and feel better.
    
    We really can... together.
    
    So sign up now and add in this free semi-precious gratitude bracelet for yourself. (Just pay the shipping).  * Only while supplies last. *
    
    We are in this together. Sending you so much love. Let’s pick our word for the year, and let it be <b>GRATITUDE.</b>
