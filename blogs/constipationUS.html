    I’ve been there! I suffered with Irritable Bowel Syndrome for years. <span class="bold">Being stressed and constipated was normal for me, until I found relief with the ancient health practice of castor oil packs and the WHY behind it all.</span> <br>
    <span class="bold">Did you know that if you sleep better, have better digestion, and reduce stress, your health would be drastically different?</span> I didn’t know this then, but now it all makes sense. <br>
    <span class="bold">The more anxious I was, the less likely I’d be to have a bowel movement.</span> At that time I thought my constipation was a stand alone issue. All <span class="bold">I wanted was to feel relaxed and ‘normal’, but it seemed impossible. Have you ever felt this way?</span> It’s not your fault, because bodies often have a mind of their own. </p>

    <p class="bold">When I actually understood how closely connected my stress and digestion was, I figured out how to give my body the reset it needed so that I could have:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Better stools</li>
        <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Better sleep</li>
        <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Less stress</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">After years of suffering, castor oil packs opened my eyes to how gut health goes beyond just the gut</span> and that sometimes our bodies need a total reset and that’s ok!<br>
        <span class="bold">Health begins in the gut, which is why castor oil packs are one of the gems in my award winning book, <a href="https://shopdrmarisol.ca/blogs/qott-blog-home-page/oh-sh-t-blog-post" target="_blank">Oh Sh*t.</a></span>

    <h2>How did I know I should try a castor oil pack? </h2>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">For years, I thought I was doing everything ‘right’.</span> Taking the right supplements, seeing a naturopathic doctor, exercising, eating healthy, <span class="bold">but still struggling with going to the bathroom. </span>Can you relate? <br>
        <span class="bold">I was so used to being constipated that it became ‘normal’ for me, know what I mean?</span> Be gentle with yourself if you relate. <br>
        <span class="bold">I hit my lowest point and became so sick that I couldn’t even get out of bed for a week, so I took the leap and made my own castor oil pack</span> after ignoring this suggestion for years.

    <h2>The 2 main ways the castor oil pack restored my gut</h2>
    <p>
        My gut was SO tense and contracted. <span class="bold">The actual castor oil pack being placed on my abdomen worked with my stress and anxiety instead of fighting against it.</span>  <br>
        Yes, castor oil packs were 100% transformative for me, but I also needed to understand the 3 keys to gut health (better stools, better sleep and less stress) and how the castor oil pack worked with the 3 keys. <br>
        To my amazement, research showed that it supported the 5 fundamental pillars of health that just happen to spell out F-A-I-T-H.  <br>
        Out of all these wonderful benefits, the ‘F’ and the ’T’ are the most important.

    <p style="margin-top: 1.6em;">
        Can’t you just drink castor oil to relieve constipation? <br>
        When you actually drink castor oil it’ll make you go to the bathroom, but in a really rough and fast way. With this in mind, it’s an excellent stimulant laxative when taken by mouth but it doesn’t stay in you long enough to put your stomach in a relaxed state and that is one of the most important keys.
