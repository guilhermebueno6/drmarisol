    <span class="bold">Anxiety is crippling.</span> You  know what I mean if you’ve ever had anxiety. It grabs a hold of you, puts pressure on your chest and makes it hard to breathe. Then you ask yourself, “Am I going to die?” Have you ever felt this way?  <br>
    I’ve been there too. I don’t know about you, but <span class="bold">the more stressed I am, the more constipated I am and the less sleep I get.</span> I was stuck in that evil cycle for years, until I discovered a new way to stop this cycle with the ancient self-care ritual of castor oil packs.

        <p>
            I discovered the code to freedom from the evil cycle and the code is F-A-I-T-H. <br>
            The code of FAITH is kind of like building a house and starting with a firm foundation. <span class="bold">The Queen of the Thrones™ Castor Oil Pack is your new op-portunity to strengthen the foundation of your health by supporting amazing stools, restful sleep, and LESS stress. Learn more about how I found all this out at one of the lowest points in my life. </span><br>
            Out of all the FAITH benefits shown above, in my opinion ’T’ is the most important. <span class="bold">You see, tension and stress inhibits our bodies’ natural ability to have a bowel movement, keep calm and sleep.</span> These three things affect everything else, make sense? <br>
            You might be thinking, <span class="bold">how can a castor oil pack that you put on your abdomen help with anxiety?</span>  <br>

    <h2>CASTOR OIL PACKS HELPS TO REDUCE BY KEEPING OUR STRESS RESPONSE BALANCED</h2>

        <p>
            The soft compression of the castor oil pack on the skin helps you to: <br> <br>
            - Stimulate sensory receptors that activate our ‘rest and digest’ state. <br> <br>
            - Promote the production of our feel-good neurotransmitter dopamine, as well as our love and connection hormone, oxytocine. <br> <br>
            <span class="bold">Get your very own Queen of the Thrones™ Castor Oil Pack Kit now!</span> <br> <br>
            <span class="bold">Anxiety is kind of like the tropical storm that all of a sudden becomes a category 5 hurricane.</span> It’s completely debilitating, destroying everything in its path, can you relate? <br> <br>
            <span class="bold">When I have times of panic, the effects of the castor oil pack working with my anxiety, prevents my whole body from being overcome with stress.</span> For this to happen you need the compress WITH the oil, you can’t get this effect alone with just the oil. It doesn’t work that way.

        <p>
            <span class="bold">Well, on a family vacation in Florida, my anxiety quickly grew from zero to one hundred when that terrible category 5 hurricane was our reality.</span> The problem was, I forgot my castor oil pack and wasn’t able to get one until the last day of the trip. <br>
            <span class="bold">Without it my body was overcome with anxiety.</span> The stress of the impending hurricane took over my body, just like I experienced many times before. <span class="bold">I was SO constipated, I couldn’t sleep and I was SO tense.</span> <br>
            <span class="bold">Guess what freed me from the evil cycle? Pooping, soon after I put my pack on.</span> Plus, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of the soft compress against your skin, giving your body a hug and releasing that dopamine! <br>
            In reality, you don’t know when a ‘hurricane’ is coming, but <span class="bold">using your castor oil pack as a daily ritual to reduce the effects of anxiety</span> will keep your body prepared for the unknown. <br>
            <span class="bold">Stools, stress and sleep are all connected. Amazing, isn’t it?</span> For more insight about that and how all health begins in the gut, check out my blog post. <br>
            <span class="bold">It’s time to start here with a new foundation, just like I did. Have FAITH in your body’s incredible ability to free yourself of that evil cycle and into feeling free within your own body.</span>
