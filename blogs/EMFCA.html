       <span class='bold'>Do you ever feel like you get stressed out super easily?</span> Chest tight, heart pounding, body overheating - you’ve tried everything to de-stress, but you feel like your body is in ‘fight or flight’ mode. Does this sound like you? I’ve been there too, and <span class='bold'>one of my silent stressors was electromagnetic frequencies (EMFs).</span> You see, EMFs can actually increase stress on your nervous system<sup>1</sup>. It wasn’t until <span class='bold'>I figured out 3 easy ways to protect my body from the effects of EMFs and stress</span> through castor oil liver packs, sleep hygiene mask and my <a href="https://offers.harmonipendant.com/mothers-day-sale/?clickid=1d123249078a4bffb670a40ccfea802c&utm_content=1d123249078a4bffb670a40ccfea802c&utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=735">Harmoni Pendant</a> that I understood the impact EMFs were having on me.
   </p>
   
   <h2 class='headings'>Could EMFs be putting more stress on your body without you knowing?</h2>
   
   <p>
   <span class='bold'>EMFs are all around us,</span> wherever there is electricity or wires, cell phones or cell phone towers.The closer that you are to the power towers, wires, or cellphone towers etc, the more you may notice an impact on your body – <span class='bold'>if you’re sensitive</span> (not everyone is). But if you are, you notice it greatly. Even if you’re not sensitive and may not be FEELING the effects, there are still things happening deep down inside that are negatively impacting your life.
   </p>

   <p>
       You’re an energetic being, you have a frequency, a vibration - just as everything does. So imagine it like this; if the ground is vibrating underneath you, like in an earthquake, you’re going to vibrate too! <br><br>
       Therefore, <span class='bold'>EMFs can exacerbate:</span>
   </p>
   
   <ul>
       <li><i class='fas fa-check'></i> <span class='bold'>Fatigue</span></li>
       <li><i class='fas fa-check'></i> <span class='bold'>Problems sleeping</span></li>
       <li><i class='fas fa-check'></i> <span class='bold'>Headaches and pain</span></li>
       <li><i class='fas fa-check'></i> <span class='bold'>Brain fog</span></li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>
       Do any of these sound like you? That was me too. <span class='bold'>All of these are signs of excess stress on your body.</span>
   </p>
   
   <h2 class='headings'>The more stress that’s on your nervous system, the harder it is for you to recover from the negative effects of EMFs and radiation.</h2>
   
   <p>
       This isn’t when I tell you I moved to the country, changed to dial-up internet and got rid of my microwave. I didn’t do any of those things, <span class='bold'>I found easy ways to make my body more resilient, so that silent stressors didn’t keep me trapped in that dreadful ‘fight or flight’ mode.</span> <br><br>
       I was so in the know about how EMFs were adding stress on my body that when I found the location for my clinic, I mapped out all the nearest energy towers and cell phone towers and made sure to stay 1-3 km away. I also don’t have Wifi internet at my clinic. <br><br>
       It’s one of the reasons that my clinical space is such a sanctuary, it has good vibes that aren’t corrupted by dirty electricity. At home, in the evening, I shut down the Wifi. I actually have it on a timer, that way it helps my family and I feel more at peace while we’re sleeping.
   </p>
   
   <h2 class='headings'>3 Ways You Can Protect your Nervous System from EMF Stress</h2>
   
   <p>
       The 3 top tools that helped me overcome stress and anxiety caused from EMFs were these:
   </p>
   
   <h2 class='headings'>1. Castor Oil Liver Packs To Balance your Stress Hormones</h2>
   
   <div class='imgLeft'>
   <img src='https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0092/0541/6032/files/Image_3.jpg?v=1619201172' alt='Castor Oil Liver Packs Balance Stress Hormones'>
   <div class='ILText'>
   <p>
       Tension and stress inhibits our bodies’ natural ability to have a bowel movement, keep calm and sleep, and added EMF stress certainly doesn’t help these things. <br><br>
       The ancient health practice of <span class='bold'> <a href="https://queenofthethrones.myshopify.com/cart/19099974860896:1?channel=buy_button">Castor Oil Liver Packs</a>  set the foundation for better health,</span> better stools, better sleep <span class='bold'>and LESS stress.</span> <br><br>
       The soft compression of the castor oil liver pack on the skin helps you to:
   </p>
   <ul>
       <li><i class='fas fa-check'></i> Balance your stress hormones.</li>
       <li><i class='fas fa-check'></i> Naturally move your body into its ‘rest and digest’ state.</li>
       <li><i class='fas fa-check'></i> Promotes the production of your feel-good hormone dopamine<sup>2</sup>, as well as oxytocin<sup>3</sup>, the ‘love’ hormone.</li>
   </ul>

   <h2 class='headings'>2. A Sleep Mask To Help you Relax as you fall asleep</h2>
   
   <div class='imgRight'>

   <div class='IRText'>
   <p>
       Wearing a white <a href="https://queenofthethrones.myshopify.com/cart/19283402621024:1?channel=buy_button">sleep mask</a> to bed balances your natural day and night hormonal rhythms and <span class='bold'>increases melatonin<sup>4</sup>, which helps you</span> get better sleep and <span class='bold'>have more resistance against dirty electricity.</span> Sounds like a win-win, right?

   <p>
       Since I usually only wear my castor oil liver pack and my sleep eye mask overnight, I also found this amazing tool that has been shown to reduce the impact of the EMFs all day long.
