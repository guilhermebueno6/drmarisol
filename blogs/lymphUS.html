<p style="margin-top: 25px;">
<span class='bold'>
    It’s almost like my body couldn’t cleanse because my lymphatic system was clogged </span>(just like
    that stuffy nose). Your lymphatic system runs throughout your whole body to clear out all the
    junk, so when it’s congested, it makes sense that your body can’t cleanse properly, right?
    Thankfully that all changed when I put on my first castor oil pack.

</p>

<h2 class="headings">My body started cleansing naturally with the help of my castor oil pack</h2>

<div class='imgLeft'>

<div class='ILText'>
    <p>
<span class='bold'>Up until then my lymphatic system couldn’t clear anything out</span> so I needed a support
system and that system ended up being the ancient health ritual of castor oil packs. Stay with
me here. <br><br>
For me, my constipation, trouble sleeping and overwhelming stress all piled up on me when I
was in my final year of naturopathic school. It got so bad that I felt like I had been poisoned and
I couldn’t get myself out of bed. Have you ever felt this way? <br><br>
You see, <span class='bold'>because my body was so congested and overcome with stress</span> I didn’t have the
energy I needed to get out of my bed. So, after ignoring the suggestion of trying a castor oil
pack for years and trying literally everything else, <span class='bold'>I decided to take a leap of faith and make
    my very own castor oil liver pack.</span>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<img src='https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0092/0541/6032/files/Image_3.jpg?v=1619201172' alt='Castor Oil Pack Resets Your Lymphatic System'>
<div class='IRText'>
  <p>  
    I poured castor oil on a really soft organic cotton flannel and placed it on my swollen belly under
    my right rib cage (over my liver). Because my lymphatic system was so clogged, there was way
    too much stress on my body so it’s almost like my body didn’t know how to relax, but that all
    changed with my castor oil pack. <br><br>
    <span class='bold'>Once I put that castor oil liver pack on, for the first time in my life I felt what relaxed was, </span> felt at peace - <span class='bold'>it was like my body and lymphatic system reset!</span> Before that I had no idea
    what relaxed actually felt like. It was as if the skies had opened up above and angels began to
    sing!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 class="headings">But how does the castor oil liver pack help your body cleanse and de-stress?</h2>

<p>
    Well, <span class='bold'>studies have shown that castor oil packs help to relieve constipation<sup>1</sup> </span> and improve
    the smooth muscle function of the digestive tract<sup>2</sup>, in turn supporting better absorption so you
    can have regular healthy bowel movements and <span class='bold'>release all the excess hormones and toxins.</span>
    Isn’t that amazing?
    Plus, when you do a castor oil liver pack, the actual compress on your skin helps to: <br><br>
    1. Activate your ‘rest and digest’ state. <br><br>
    2. Promote the production of dopamine<sup>3</sup>, your ‘feel good’ hormone. <br><br>
    3. Release oxytocin<sup>4</sup>, your love and connection hormone (kind of like a cozy hug). <br><br>
    For me, the combination of the castor oil working with the soft organic compress was kind of like
    getting a back massage for the first time. My stomach was relaxing so I could go to the
    bathroom and cleanse. Plus, I was less stressed and I was even sleeping better!</p>

<h2 class='headings'>When your lymphatic system can cleanse, your body lets go of all that excess
    stress</h2>

<p>
    Now that I was cleansing, <span class='bold'>I had more energy and I wasn’t congested</span> like I was so used to! My lymphatic system was working the way it should and <span class='bold'>I knew what it was like to have less stress on my body.</span> 
    <br><br>
    I felt better in every way, kind of like the feeling of being able to breathe and smell through your nose after that head cold heals. Sounds good, right?
    <br><br>
    <span class='bold'>With the castor oil pack I’m healthier now at age 42 than I was at 26</span>, because I was used to every part of my body being overwhelmed with stress that I had no idea how life could feel on the other side of that leap of faith.
    <br><br>
    Plus, <span class='bold'>when you balance the amount of stress in your body, all other systems start to get better, including your lymphatic system. </span>
    <br><br>
    That’s why I love what I do and why <span class='bold'>I’m so happy to be a part of The Lymphatic Rescue Summit</span>, hosted online with Shivan Sarna, Founder of SIBO SOS from April 19-25. <span class='bold'>I invite you to join me on April 23 for my online masterclass all about how the brain and lymphatic system connect.</span>
    <br><br>
    We all have a story to tell and I am looking forward to gathering with you (virtually) so that you
    will know just how impactful the connection between your brain, your stress and your lymphatic
    system really is.
