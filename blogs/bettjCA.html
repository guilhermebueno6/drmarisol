<div class="IRText">
<p><span class="bold">Do you ever wish you could put all your stress in a bag and throw it out with your weekly trash?</span> Trust me, I sure do! <span class="bold">For me, my stress always showed up in my gut, so I thought getting rid of my stress was the only solution for healing my gut.</span> Can you relate? <br><br> <span class="bold">I was chasing how to get rid of my stress but I had it all wrong for years until discovering castor oil packs and beetroot juice.</span> Stay with me here, ok? <br><br> <span class="bold">When I was stressed, I would then be so constipated and so bloated that people would actually ask me if I was pregnant.</span> Awkward, right? <br><br> <span class="bold">I tried everything to reduce my stress: trying to zen out with meditation, mountains of supplements, trying to stretch up to the sun with yoga, and nothing worked.</span> Do you feel this is you? <br><br> You may have heard that stress is the number one cause of disease over inflammation. So it makes sense that we just want to throw out stress, take it out to the curb, right? But let’s face it, how easy is that? <br><br> Let me tell you, it’s not easy for me. If you feel the same, don’t worry, because where there’s a will there’s a way! <span class="bold">You see, I couldn’t control when stress would happen BUT I could control my gut health and my gut’s reaction to stress.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>How did I do it, you ask? All I did was heal my gut from:</p>
<ol>
<li class="bold">1. The outside in with castor oil packs.</li>
<li class="bold">2. The inside out with my very own beetroot juice recipe.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bold">The best part? Both work together to support your bodies’ reaction to stress by restoring your gut health and fueling your body, which is KEY!</span> Kind of like how a car needs fuel to run, our bodies need fuel too and I guess you could call your gut the gas tank!</p>

<div class="ILText">
<p><span class="bold">After multiple recommendations over the years, I started doing this ancient health practice that everyone told me about: the CASTOR OIL PACK.</span> <br><br> When I started using it I experienced amazing benefits! It was like every part of me was starting to reset and <span class="bold">I was finally having:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bold">
<i class="fas fa-check"></i> Amazing stools</li>
<li class="bold">
<i class="fas fa-check"></i> Restful sleep</li>
<li class="bold">
<i class="fas fa-check"></i> LESS stress</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">It’s not that it actually fixed my stress, it worked WITH my stress and healed my gut in the process.</span> My life began to feel more like play rather than work. Sounds great, right? <br><br> <span class="bold">You see, up until then I always felt like my gut was on fire,</span> my belly was always itchy, which is a key warning sign that something is off. <span class="bold">So, the castor oil pack was kind of like the water hose I needed to keep the fire from coming back.</span> <br><br> <span class="bold">This wasn’t just another supplement, it felt like a complete reset for my body, and more importantly: a natural way to relax my gut despite stress.</span> <br><br> What came next was <span class="bold">healing my gut from the inside out through beets and other gut healing foods.</span></p>

<h2 class="headings">: How I restored my gut health with beet juice</h2>

<div class="IRText">
<p>As a child, <span class="bold">I saw my mom eat beets and boy oh boy, they made her go to the bathroom like nobody’s business!</span> I kept that in mind when I was searching for food to help my gut. Thanks, mom! <br><br>But my search didn’t stop at beets. <span class="bold">I used the knowledge I had from my years of Naturopathic College and paired that with the healing I experienced with castor oil packs to develop my very own beet juice recipe that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bold">
<i class="fas fa-check"></i> Serves as a firefighter in the belly (reduces inflammation)</li>
<li class="bold">
<i class="fas fa-check"></i> Helps to heal the gut lining</li>
<li class="bold">
<i class="fas fa-check"></i> Improves the stomach’s defence against infection</li>
</ul>
<p>I always try out everything on myself first, then my friends and family, then my patients. With this beet juice, the more relief I felt, the more I realized that healing from the inside out was just as important as the outside in. <br><br> <span class="bold">This recipe is 4 simple ingredients that work on the 4 same mechanisms as the castor oil pack (from the inside out) that actually work WITH your stress and help you go from stressed to BLESSED! Sound good?</span></p>

<h2 class="headings">Why did I need my castor oil pack and my beet juice recipe to maintain my gut health?</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0092/0541/6032/files/MG_0941.jpg?v=1618896366" alt="Castor Oil Packs And Beet Juice Improve Your Gut Health">
<p>You see, everything has an opposite, a ying and a yang. <span class="bold"> So, once I started experiencing healing from the outside in with castor oil packs, it only made sense to explore what healing from the inside out could be.</span> <br><br> <span class="bold">Have you ever wondered if there was a way for food to be your medicine?</span> Even if you’re not sure, that’s ok! <span class="bold">I want to give you the same opportunity I had to experience healing from the inside out.</span> <br><br> Beets are a source of nitric oxide₁, similar to the castor oil pack₂, so beets also act as a natural anti inflammatory for your gut lining. That fact alone was proof enough for me.</p>

<p>I know what you’re probably thinking, “I doubt my stressed gut can be reset by a juice recipe and a castor oil pack.” <br><br> Trust me, I had my doubts too. <span class="bold">This isn’t another supplement or diet plan, this is a new opportunity for you to equip your gut with the support it needs when stress comes your way.</span> <br><br> <span class="bold">You may not see results as quickly as I did because everyone heals at their own pace and that’s ok! But don’t give up!</span> You see, changing the foundation of your gut health is kind of like building a house from the ground up. What I mean is, it takes time to pour the cement and for the foundation to dry in order for the building to begin, similar to your gut. Make sense? <br><br> <span class="bold">Now is your opportunity to take a leap of faith and start your system rebuild. Will you take the leap with me?</span></p>

<h2 class="headings">How did I know stress was impacting my gut health?</h2>
<p><span class="bold">Well, the gut is the central hub of our bodies.</span> It makes sense when you think about how you even carry emotions in your gut. Have you ever felt butterflies in your tummy when you’re nervous or excited? What about those dreaded knots when you’re stressed?</p>

<p><span class="bold">The gut is kind of like Grand Central Station for your body, know what I mean?</span> <br><br> So it makes sense that ‘all systems go’ when your gut is running smoothly. <span class="bold">Restoring my gut health gave my stress a softer landing and I was able to cope with it much better and I want the same for you. </span> <br><br> <span class="bold">You see, when I understood that stress wasn’t the villain, I looked at my health and healing in a whole new way.</span> I was able to actually listen to what my body needed, rather than chasing the impossible task of getting rid of stress. <br><br> <span class="bold">So why not focus on what we can control rather than what we can’t?</span></p>
